# Markers for test categorization
markers =
    unit: Unit tests (no API calls, fast)
    smoke: Quick smoke tests (minimal API calls)
    behavior: Behavior validation tests (moderate API calls)
    e2e: End-to-end tests (expensive, full scenarios)
    integration: All integration tests (smoke + behavior + e2e)
    slow: Slow tests (subset of integration tests that are heavier and can be selected explicitly)
